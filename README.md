## About

`opengles2-2d-demos` is a simple android 4.0 application that showcases some simple 2d examples in OpenGL ES 2.0. This project serve as a sample for how to effectively use OpenGL ES 2.0 for a 2d application (ex: a game) and to track my personal progress on the subject. All samples are made in the most legible possible way I could find and are full of comments explaining the important stuff.

Be warned that **every** file is standalone - this generate a lot of code duplication, *BUT* it's slightly easier to follow (you only need to look to the file that shows what you're interested, no need to "hunt" initialization routines, etc.). In short, don't use this project structure to do anything serious or you will probably be murdered by your manager and/or teammates.
